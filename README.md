# Faderfox Controller Editor (Web-MIDI)
This project offers browser-based editors for MIDI controllers by [faderfox.de](http://faderfox.de).

To use this editor you need a Web-MIDI-enabled webbrowser. Currently only Google Chrome (since Version 49 with sysex-support) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) support Web-MIDI.

## EC4 Editor

Editor for the [EC4 Encoder Controller](http://www.faderfox.de/ec4.html). You can find a ready-to-use version under [https://www.privatepublic.de/faderfox-editor/ec4](https://www.privatepublic.de/faderfox-editor/ec4).

## PC4 editor

Editor for the [PC4 Pot Controller](http://faderfox.de/pc4.html). You can find a ready-to-use version under [https://www.privatepublic.de/faderfox-editor/pc4](https://www.privatepublic.de/faderfox-editor/pc4).


This software was developed in co-operation with faderfox.


## EC4 Editor reimplementation

A copycat reimplementation of the EC4 editor is available at [https://lsim.github.io/faderfox-editor/](https://lsim.github.io/faderfox-editor/).

Imitation is the highest form of flattery, after all ðŸ˜‰

I wanted to contribute new features but was not up to the task of properly working with the original implementation.

A few extra features have been added compared to the (already awesome) original editor.

- Storage of configuration data in the browser's IndexedDb
- Auto saving of data to the db (page reload no longer a thing to be feared!)
- Multiple named configuration 'bundles' can be switched between, saved to a .syx file or sent to the EC4
- Sysex dumps from the EC4 are shown as new bundles
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Easy copy/paste of individual encoders in addition to groups/setups (as in the original). Tip: copying between bundles also works.
- Pause-screen-animation when left idle ðŸ˜€

#### Some planned features

These may or may not materialize as this has been a hobby project and I may lose interest at any time ðŸ˜€

- Undo/Redo
- Built-in sharing of groups/setups between users
- More advanced macro functionality

#### Drawbacks of the reimplementation
Lack of battle hardening means you may encounter bugs. I haven't had time to test the editor extensively, so please report any issues you find.

Unlike the original editor (which astonishingly is dependency free) this one has a huge dependency tree. This makes it more prone to 'npm rot' and so it may not fare as well over time as the original. The hope is that the trade-off will be that new features can be added faster.
